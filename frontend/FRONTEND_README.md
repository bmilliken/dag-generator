# DAG Generator Frontend

A React-based frontend for visualizing and interacting with DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) generated by the DAG Generator backend.

## Features

- **Interactive DAG Visualization**: Drag and drop nodes to reorganize the DAG layout
- **Real-time Updates**: Connect to the backend API to fetch live DAG data
- **Project Switching**: Switch between different projects in real-time
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, clean interface that works across different screen sizes
- **Connection Visualization**: Animated connections showing data flow between tables
- **Mini Map**: Navigate large DAGs with an overview mini-map
- **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out and reset view

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Make sure the backend is running:**
   The frontend expects the backend API to be running on `http://localhost:5000`

4. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **React Flow** for interactive node-based graphs
- **Axios** for API communication

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through these endpoints:

- `GET /project` - Get current project information
- `POST /project/<name>` - Switch to a different project  
- `GET /dag` - Fetch complete DAG structure
- `GET /health` - Health check

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
